## Instructions for use:

File VC10_W.ac is a replacement model file.  Apart from some tweaks it is basically the same as the existing model file (VC10.ac) but texture-mapped to accept liveries. It is currently mapped to the graphic file "texMap.png".

Rename the old VC10.ac in VC10/Models/ (to something like VC10-original.ac as a backup

rename VC10_W.ac to VC10.ac and move it into VC10/Models/

Move texMap.png into VC10/Models/
